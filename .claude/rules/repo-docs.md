# Repository Documentation Rules

*Actionable rules: see Pre-Commit Checklist items #6, #8, #11, #12, #13 in CLAUDE.md.*

## ARCHITECTURE.md Structural Updates

The Mermaid diagram in `repository-information/ARCHITECTURE.md` shows the project's file structure and relationships. It is updated only when the project structure changes (files added, moved, or deleted) — **not** on version bumps. Version numbers are not displayed in diagram nodes; STATUS.md serves as the version dashboard.

### Adding new pages
When a new embedding page is created (see New Embedding Page Setup Checklist in `.claude/rules/html-pages.md`), add corresponding nodes to the diagram:
- A page node: `NEWPAGE["page-name.html"]`
- A version file node: `NEWVER["page-namehtml.version.txt"]`

## Keeping Documentation Files in Sync

*Mandatory rules: see Pre-Commit Checklist items #5, #6, #7, #8 in CLAUDE.md. Reference table below for additional files to consider.*

| File | Update when... |
|------|---------------|
| `.gitignore` | New file types or tooling is introduced that generates artifacts (e.g. adding Node tooling, Python venvs, build outputs) |
| `.editorconfig` | New file types are introduced that need specific formatting rules |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Development workflow changes, new conventions are added to CLAUDE.md that contributors need to know |
| `SECURITY.md` | New attack surfaces are added (e.g. new API endpoints, new OAuth flows, new deployment targets) |
| `CITATION.cff` | Project name, description, authors, or URLs change |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml` | New project areas are added (update the "Affected Area" / "Area" dropdown options) |
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | New checklist items become relevant (e.g. new conventions, new mandatory checks) |

Update these only when the change is genuinely relevant — don't force unnecessary edits.

## Internal Link Reference

*Rule: see Pre-Commit Checklist item #12 in CLAUDE.md.*

Files live in three locations: repo root, `.github/`, and `repository-information/`. Cross-directory links must use `../` to traverse up before descending into the target directory.

### Why community health files live at root (not `.github/`)
Community health files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) live at root so relative links resolve correctly in both GitHub blob-view and sidebar-tab contexts — files inside `.github/` break in the sidebar tab because `../` traverses GitHub's URL structure differently there.

### File locations
| File | Actual path |
|------|-------------|
| README.md | `./README.md` (root) |

| LICENSE.md | `./LICENSE.md` (root) |
| CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | `./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (root) |
| CONTRIBUTING.md | `./CONTRIBUTING.md` (root) |
| SECURITY.md | `./SECURITY.md` (root) |
| PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | `repository-information/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| CHANGELOG.md | `repository-information/CHANGELOG.md` |
| CHANGELOG-archive.md | `repository-information/CHANGELOG-archive.md` |

| STATUS.md | `repository-information/STATUS.md` |
| SUPPORT.md | `repository-information/SUPPORT.md` |

### Common cross-directory link patterns
| From directory | To file in `repository-information/` | Correct relative path |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `.github/` | `repository-information/SUPPORT.md` | `../repository-information/SUPPORT.md` |
| `.github/` | `repository-information/CHANGELOG.md` | `../repository-information/CHANGELOG.md` |

| From directory | To root files | Correct relative path |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `repository-information/` | `README.md` | `../README.md` |
| `repository-information/` | `CLAUDE.md` | `../CLAUDE.md` |
| `repository-information/` | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | `../CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| `repository-information/` | `SECURITY.md` | `../SECURITY.md` |
| `repository-information/` | `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | `../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` |
| `.github/` | `README.md` | `../README.md` |
| `.github/` | `CLAUDE.md` | `../CLAUDE.md` |

## Relative Path Resolution on GitHub

Relative links in markdown files resolve from the blob-view URL directory (`/org/repo/blob/main/...`). Each `../` climbs one URL segment. Root files need 2 `../` to reach `/org/repo/`, subdirectory files need 3. This works on any fork because the org/repo name is part of the URL itself.

### When relative paths work vs. don't

| Context | Works? | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Markdown files (`.md`) rendered on GitHub | Yes | GitHub renders links as `<a href="...">`, browser resolves relative paths from blob-view URL |
| YAML config files (`config.yml`, `CITATION.cff`) | No | GitHub processes these as structured data, not rendered markdown — relative URLs may not be resolved |
| Mermaid diagram text labels | No | Text content inside code blocks, not rendered as clickable links |
| GitHub Pages URLs (`org.github.io/repo`) | No | Different domain entirely — can't be reached via relative path from `github.com`. Use a placeholder (e.g. `*(deploy to activate)*`) and replace via drift check step #4 |

### Adding new relative links

When creating a new markdown file with links to GitHub web app routes (issues, security advisories, settings, etc.):

1. Determine the file's directory depth relative to the repo root
2. Add 2 for `blob/main/` (or `blob/{branch}/`) to get the total `../` count needed to reach `/org/repo/`
3. Append the GitHub route (e.g. `security/advisories/new`, `issues/new`)
4. **Never** hardcode the org or repo name in markdown links that can use this pattern
5. **For GitHub Pages links** — `github.io` URLs can't be made dynamic via relative paths. Use placeholder text (e.g. `*(deploy to activate)*`) and document the replacement in drift check step #4

## Markdown Formatting

When editing `.md` files and you need multiple lines to render as **separate rows** (not collapsed into a single paragraph), use HTML inline elements:
- **Line breaks:** end each line (except the last) with `<br>` to force a newline
- **Indentation:** start each line with `&emsp;` (em space) to add a visual indent

Example source:
```markdown
The framework handles:

&emsp;First item<br>
&emsp;Second item<br>
&emsp;Third item
```

Plain markdown collapses consecutive indented lines into one paragraph — `<br>` and `&emsp;` are the reliable way to get separate indented rows on GitHub.
